      <h2>Website Release!</h2>
      <h6>September 18th, 2017</h6>
      <p class="article_main">Eyy! So we finally got the blog launched. Weird to see I posted twice before even being released. Once again, our code is available on GitHub with the link at the bottom of the page.<br /> - Pixel</p>

      <h2>Server Prune and Policy Changes</h2>
      <h6>September 17th, 2017</h6>
      <p class="article_main">Hey everyone! Just a heads up to let the server know that the server will be having a <strong>prune</strong> on the 20th of September which is Wednesday. Eco describes it pretty well in this announcement. <br /><img src="http://i.cubeupload.com/0EStIQ.png"> <br /> What is a prune? <br /> A prune is where inactive users are removed from the server to make VWC appear more professional and less dead (which it is at the moment, but the staff and I are working on stuff to turn that around). Anyone without the Macaroon role (or they have a blue nametag) and who hasn't been on in a couple days is at risk to be kicked. Don't worry, if you're kicked and you decide to come back, you are free to do so as long as you stay active and follow the rules. <br />Also, there was a rule change a few days ago regarding the policy on NSFW content. After seeing a user with an icon of a woman with partially exposed breasts, a group decision was made and the No NSFW rule now applies to icons and usernames instead of just messages. Swearing is still a vague topic at the moment. I believe it's allowed but discouraged. Stay tuned for anything else that needs to be noted later this week. <br /> - Pixel</p>

      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <h6>September 17th, 2017</h6>
      <p class="article-main">What's up everyone? This is my first post on the Vanilla Wine Cookies blog. Surprisingly, this post will be released before the website's code is even thrown onto GitHub Pages to be seen by all. That might be a little weird. IDK. Stay tuned. <br /> -Pixel</p>
