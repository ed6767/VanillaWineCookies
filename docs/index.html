    <h3>Ranks</h3>
    <!-- The CSS file should determine the titles of each rank are similar colors to the roles in the Discord server. The HTML file should also provide an accurate description of each rank's meanings and perks. -->
    <i>Ranks are listed from highest to lowest. Each description also has a TLDR variant for people who are too lazy to read. The TLDR descriptions are a little less accurate though, so it's better to read the whole thing.</i>
    <!-- TLDR descriptions are SATIRE! -->
      <div id="ranklist">
        <h4 class="rank_kingcookie">King Cookie</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: The BAWS</i></p>
        <p>The <s>king</s> owner of Vanilla Wine Cookies. Not the developer of the webpage though. ;)</p>
        <h4 class="rank_oreo">Oreo</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: overpowered admins</i></p>
        <p>Oreos are VWC's moderators and admins. Please respect them.</p>
        <h4 class="rank_ccc">Chocolate Chip Cookie</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: JUNIOR MODS</i></p>
        <p> Chocolate Chip Cookies (or CCC's as I like to call them) are junior moderators. They have limited abilities but please respect them.</p>
        <h4 class="rank_goldencookie">Golden Cookie</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: VIP</i></p>
        <p>Golden Cookies are VWC's veterans. The most active users on the server recieve this rank for free as a sort of "thank-you."</p>
        <h4 class="rank_oatmealcookie">Oatmeal Cookie</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: YOUTUBERS</i></p>
        <p>Oatmeal Cookies are VWC's content creators. Some of the original Oatmeal Cookies include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcNgkkJV2R-vpGvirCClYOw?&ab_channel=EcoScratcher">Econinja</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSNSLlju_C_bVpV4dFOmxqQ?&ab_channel=LeafProductions">WaffleChurro/Leaf Productions</a>, and formerly <a href="https://www.twitter.com/MasterJPixelTV">MasterJPixelTV</a> (the cool guy who built this website.)
        <h4 class="rank_sprinklebiscuit">Sprinkle Biscuit</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: children who like to rant</i></p>
        <p>Sprinkle Biscuits is a specific role for people that like to rant, specifically about a certain website called Scratch. Having this role unlocks the #scratch channel, although anything that follows the rules can be discussed there.</p>
        <h4 class="rank_macaroon">Macaroon</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: THE AVERAGE DISNEY CHANNEL VIEWER</i></p>
        <p>Macaroons are VWC's normal members and have a green nametag on the member list and on their messages. The Macaroon tag is usually given to users after staff can determine that the user is a real person and not a bot, fake account, and/or scammer.</p>
        <h4 class="rank_gingerbread">Gingerbread</h4>
        <p><i>TLDR: UNVERIFIED LOSERS</i></p>
        <p>Gingerbread is the role added to new users upon joining the server and has a blue nametag on the member list and on their messages. This role represents unverified accounts that have either recently joined VWC or may not be real people, or both. Once higher-ranked personell determine the user is real, they will be moved up to the Macaroon rank <i>(see above)</i>.</p>
        <h4>Other Roles</h4>
        <p>The server has a few other miscellanous roles, including bot-specific roles and the infamous Muted role. Muted is a feature by Dyno (a moderation bot) that upon staff's command, will temporarily "mute" a user and prevent them from typing in text channels. This is usually used as a punishment for when a user violates a rule.</p>
